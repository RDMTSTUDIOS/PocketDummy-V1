# PocketDummy_V1

To load on page:

```ts
import PocketDummy from "PocketDummy_V1";
PocketDummy.Display();
```

As mentioned in the header - it's dummy.

The idea was to create an interface, which parts communicates with each other by the pipeline concept. Basically - to test an idea of the [CozyPorts](https://github.com/RDMTSTUDIOS/CozyPorts) and the `DummyKernel`, which is currently in development.
