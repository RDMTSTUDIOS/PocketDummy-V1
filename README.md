# PocketDummy_V1

To load on page:

```ts
import PocketDummy from "PocketDummy_V1";
PocketDummy.Display();
```

As mentioned in header - it's dummy.
The idea was create an interface, which parts communicates with each other with the pipeline concept. Basically - to test an idea of the `DummyKernel` (which is currently in development) and the `CozyPorts`.
